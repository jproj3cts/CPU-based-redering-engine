# CPU-based-redering-engine

So this is just a basic little program I adapted from the code written by Andy Sloane, the original can be found here: https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html.

The original was written as an obfuscated c program, so was more about form than function. Still it was very elegant in its function.

I have seperated out the condensed code into a more general and adaptable form. As such this engine is capable of rendering any 3D shape you can produce a parametric function for and from any distance or angle.
